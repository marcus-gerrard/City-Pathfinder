# City-Pathfinder
 A comparison of different pathfinding algorithms in actual cities.

 ## Supported Pathfinding Algorithms
 Below is the list of current supported pathfinding algorithms, this is still a work in progress so this list will expand.
 1. Breadth-first search
 2. A-star using haversine distance as the heuristic
